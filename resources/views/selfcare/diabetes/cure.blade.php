			<p class="lead" style="font-size: 27px;"> Treatment and Drugs</p>
			<p>Treatment for type 1 diabetes includes:</p>
			<ul>
			    <li>Taking insulin</li>
			    <li>Carbohydrate counting</li>
			    <li>Frequent blood sugar monitoring</li>
			    <li>Eating healthy foods</li>
			    <li>Exercising regularly and maintaining a healthy weight</li>
			</ul>
				<p>The goal is to keep your blood sugar level as close to normal as possible to delay or prevent complications. Although there are exceptions, generally, the goal is to keep your daytime blood sugar levels before meals between 70 and 130 mg/dL (3.9 to 7.2 mmol/L) and your after meal numbers no higher than 180 mg/dL (10 mmol/L) two hours after eating.</p>
				<p>Good diabetes management can be overwhelming, especially when you're first diagnosed. Take it one day at a time. And remember that you're not alone. You'll work closely with your diabetes treatment team to keep your blood sugar level as close to normal as possible.</p>

				<p class="lead" style="font-size: 27px;"> Medications and Insulin</p>
				<p>You may or may not need medications and insulin to maintain your blood sugar levels. This is something that will be decided by many factors, such as other health conditions you may have, and your blood sugar levels.
				<p> Some medications for treating type 2 diabetes, according to the <a href="">Mayo Clinic,</a> are:</p>
				<ul>
				    <li><strong>Pramlintide (Symlin).</strong> An injection of this medication before you eat can slow the movement of food through your stomach to curb the sharp increase in blood sugar that occurs after meals. </li>
				    <li><strong>High blood pressure medications.</strong> Your doctor may prescribe medications known as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), because these medications also can help keep your kidneys healthy. These medications are recommended for people with diabetes that have blood pressures above 140/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). </li>
				    <li><strong>Aspirin.</strong> Your doctor may recommend you take baby or regular aspirin daily to protect your heart. </li>
				    <li><strong>Cholesterol-lowering drugs.</strong> Your doctor may not wait until your cholesterol is elevated before he or she prescribes cholesterol-lowering agents known as statins. Cholesterol guidelines tend to be more aggressive for people with diabetes because of the elevated risk of heart disease. The American Diabetes Association recommends that low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or "bad") cholesterol be below 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L), and if you already have heart disease, your LDL goal is below 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). Your high-density lipoprotein (HDL, or "good") cholesterol is recommended to be over 50 mg/dL (1.3 mmol/L) in women and over 40 mg/dL (1 mmol/L) in men. Triglycerides, another type of blood fat, are ideal when they're less than 150 mg/dL (1.7 mmol/L).<strong></strong> </li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Common Drugs/Medicines</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>insulin glulisine (Apidra)</li>
					<li>insulin lispro(Humalog)</li>
					<li>insulin aspart(Novolog)</li>
					<li>insulin glargine (Lantus)</li>
					<li>insulin detemir (Levemir)</li>
					<li>insulin isophane (Humulin N, Novolin N)</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="lead" style="font-size: 27px;">Blood sugar monitoring</p>
				<p>Depending on what type of insulin therapy you select or require &mdash; twice daily injections, multiple daily injections or insulin pump &mdash; you may need to check and record your blood sugar level at least four times a day, and generally more often. The American Diabetes Association recommends testing blood sugar levels before meals and snacks, before bed, before exercising or driving, and if you suspect you have low blood sugar. Careful monitoring is the only way to make sure that your blood sugar level remains within your target range. Be sure to wash your hands before checking your blood sugar levels.</p>
				<p>Even if you take insulin and eat on a rigid schedule, the amount of sugar in your blood can change unpredictably. With help from your diabetes treatment team, you'll learn how your blood sugar level changes in response to food, activity, illness, medications, stress, hormonal changes and alcohol.</p>
				<p>Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is the newest way to monitor blood sugar levels, and may be especially helpful for preventing hypoglycemia. Plus, when used by people older than 25, the devices have been shown to lower A1C.</p>
				<p>Continuous glucose monitors attach to the body using a fine needle just under the skin that checks blood glucose level every few minutes. CGM isn't yet considered as accurate as standard blood sugar monitoring, so it's not considered a replacement method for keeping track of blood sugar, but an additional tool for some people.</p>			
				<p class="lead" style="font-size: 27px;"> Healthy eating and monitoring carbohydrates</p>
				<p>Contrary to popular perception, there's no such thing as a diabetes diet. However, it's important to center your diet on nutritious, low-fat, high-fiber foods such as: </p>
				<ul>
				    <li>Fruits </li>
				    <li>Vegetables </li>
				    <li>Whole grains </li>
				</ul>
				<p>Your dietitian will recommend that you eat fewer animal products and refined carbohydrates, such as white bread and sweets. This healthy eating plan is recommended for everyone, even people without diabetes.</p>
				<p>You'll need to learn how to count the amount of carbohydrates in the foods you eat so that you can give yourself enough insulin to properly metabolize those carbohydrates. A registered dietitian can help you create a meal plan that fits your health goals, food preferences and lifestyle.</p>
